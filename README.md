# Numerical-Methods

# Project Data Archive

This repository contains two ZIP archives with results from the numerical methods project. Each archive is organized into policy scenario folders, and each scenario folder includes both figures and tables.

## 📦 ZIP Folder Structure

Each ZIP file contains the following directory layout:

## 📁 Folder Descriptions

- **Baseline/**  
  Contains outputs for the benchmark (no-intervention) policy scenario.

- **Public_Guarantees/**  
  Contains results under public guarantee schemes.

- **Public_Subsidies/**  
  Contains results under public subsidies to projects.

Each scenario folder has:
- `Tables/` — CSV, Excel, or LaTeX tables summarizing results.
- `Figures/` — Graphical outputs such as supply/demand curves, welfare charts, etc.

## 🔖 Notes

- File names within the folders follow a consistent naming convention for easy identification.
- Each ZIP archive corresponds to a specific data subset or modeling variation.
